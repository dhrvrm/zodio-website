# Community Guidelines

Welcome to the ZODIO community. If you’re honest, kind, and respectful to others, you’ll always be welcome here. If you choose not to be, you may not last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it doesn’t offend others. Everyone is held to the same standard on ZODIO. We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our community guidelines both on and offline. You heard that right: your offline behavior can lead to the termination of your ZODIO account.

An opportunity to explore how you communicate, what kinds of people you are attracted to, and what your nonnegotiables are.
Attraction is part of it & that's Ok: It can feel alienating and superficial to swipe right or left on people's faces. But recognize that attraction is simply one part of dating rather than a crass behavior that only exists on dating apps. You'll be making dating much easier on yourself. And also understand that attraction is idiosyncratic, totally unique to you, and ever-evolving—so what you find attractive today might be different six months from now.

Know your expectations, no matter what they are.
It's totally fine if you want to use ZODIO for casual hookups, but know that going into it. By the same token, if you want something more serious, own that. It does not make you a monogamy-obsessed loser if you sign up for ZODIO because you want a relationship. But you do need to take responsibility for your expectations. It will make the whole process less confusing for everyone if you know what you want.
Unmatch anyone the minute they say something that makes you uncomfortable.
Don't engage with people who make gross or strange comments or try to engage with you in less-than-appropriate ways. You might be tempted to scold them for uncouth comments, but it's ultimately not worth your energy. If they are the type of people who act like that, they are not going to be the kind of people who will listen to your pleas for decency.

Make reference to one of your nonnegotiables—at the get-go.
This can be a game-changer in terms of setting your intentions and being authentic. Before deciding if someone is worth your time, mention a core value or something you care about right from the get-go. You can even put it right in your bio.
For example, you can write that you are a feminist. Or if you care about climate change, you can say so. It doesn't even need to be a serious value—maybe you value an active lifestyle, and it's important for the person in your life to do the same.
If you don't want to make it part of your bio, drop in a subtle reference to something you care about right at the get-go as a litmus test for whether or not you and your ZODIO match are "on the same page" ideologically and otherwise.

Make jokes, and realize the importance of humor in dating.
Assert some element of humor, immediately. Love thrives with laughter. However, we all have different senses of humor, so your brand of humor may be vastly different from another's. Try to toss out jokes to see if you are compatible in that way.
Chat with people long enough to get a vibe for them.
